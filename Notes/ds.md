# Data Structures

A specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data ie. arrangement of data so that they can be used efficiently in memory.

There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.
Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.

## DS

DS
    Linear
        Static
            Array
        Dynamic
            Stack Queue LinkedList
    Non-linear
        Tree Graph

- Stack: Ordered list of similar datatype (LIFO structure)
- Queue: FIFO abstract data structure
- Linked list: Linear ds where each element is separate datatype
- Graph traversal: Traversing a graph involves iterating over all nodes in some manner
- Tree traversal: Traversing a tree involves iterating over all nodes in some manner
- Heap: a special tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
